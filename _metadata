Breakable objects drop orbs slightly less frequently than standard. NPCs and tougher monsters drop roughly twice as many orbs as standard.\n\nArtwork is derived from vanilla assets and should be considered WIP and subject to change.\n\nAll other mods' NPCs should function with this mod out of the box. Any monsters and objects added by mods would need to be patched in explicitly.\n\nFor more, click the MEGATHREAD link from the steam page.",
