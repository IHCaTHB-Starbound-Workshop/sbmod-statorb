^#5aa9d6;Adds ''heal-on-pickup'' recovery orbs a la Zelda, Diablo, Castlevania, et al.^reset;

Orbs are dropped by NPCs, breakable objects, and all monster types. Breakable objects drop orbs slightly less frequently than standard. NPCs and tougher monsters drop roughly twice as many orbs as standard.

Artwork is derived from vanilla assets and should be considered WIP and subject to change.

All other mods' NPCs should function with this mod out of the box. Any monsters and objects added by mods would need to be patched in explicitly. See forum post for list of mod inclusion requests and completions.
